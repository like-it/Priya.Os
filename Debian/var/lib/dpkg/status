Description: replacement for GNU Pth using system threads
 nPth is a non-preemptive threads implementation using an API very
 similar to the one known from GNU Pth. It has been designed as a
 replacement of GNU Pth for non-ancient operating systems. In
 contrast to GNU Pth it is based on the system's standard threads
 implementation. Thus nPth allows the use of libraries which are not
 compatible to GNU Pth.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Version: 0.17024-1

Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its

 level of interest and reliability depending on the manufacturer. This will
 often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI,
 ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel,
 USB).
 .
 Beware that DMI data have proven to be too unreliable to be blindly trusted.
 Dmidecode does not scan the hardware, it only reports what the BIOS told it to.

 provides a method of displaying several different types of dialog boxes
 from shell scripts. This allows a developer of a script to interact with
 the user in a much friendlier manner.

 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Description: system and service manager
 systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It provides aggressive
 parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting
 services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
 elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
 .
 systemd is compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts and can work as a
 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/bin/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 The Linux Kernel Device Mapper is the LVM (Linux Logical Volume Management)
 Team's implementation of a minimalistic kernel-space driver that handles
 volume management, while keeping knowledge of the underlying device layout
 in user-space.  This makes it useful for not only LVM, but software raid,
 and other drivers that create "virtual" block devices.
 .
 This package contains a utility for modifying device mappings.

Pre-Depends: libc6 (>= 2.17)
Suggests: diffutils-doc, wdiff
Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

 .
 This is a transitional dummy package.  The 'git-core' package has been
 renamed to 'git', which has been installed automatically.  This
 git-core package is now obsolete, and can safely be removed from the
 system if no other package depends on it.

Description: process scheduling daemon
 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package does not provide any system maintenance tasks. Basic
 periodic maintenance tasks are provided by other packages, such
 as checksecurity.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

Description: X C Binding
 This package contains the library files needed to run software using libxcb,
 the X C Binding.
 .
 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: reliable system and kernel logging daemon
 Rsyslog is a multi-threaded implementation of syslogd (a system utility
 providing support for message logging), with features that include:
  * reliable syslog over TCP, SSL/TLS and RELP
  * on-demand disk buffering
  * email alerting
  * writing to MySQL or PostgreSQL databases (via separate output plugins)
  * permitted sender lists
  * filtering on any part of the syslog message
  * on-the-wire message compression
  * fine-grained output format control
  * failover to backup destinations
  * enterprise-class encrypted syslog relaying
 .
 It is the default syslogd on Debian systems.
