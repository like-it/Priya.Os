This module contains JavaScript bindings based on gobject-introspection.

Because JavaScript is pretty free-form, consistent coding style and unit tests
are critical to give it some structure and keep it readable.
We propose that all GNOME usage of JavaScript conform to the style guide
in doc/Style_Guide.txt to help keep things sane.

This module is prototyping https://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals/InstalledTests
To run the tests, simply build it as normal.  Now:

cd installed-tests
./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=... && make && make install
$prefix/libexec/gjs/gjs-installed-tests
