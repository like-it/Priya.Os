How Active Directory domains are discovered
============================================

AD servers are located using the standard DNS kerberos SRV records
and the Microsoft standard subzone for the domain. For example:

 * A SRV record: _kerberos._udp.example.com
 * An MSDCS subzone: _msdcs.example.com
