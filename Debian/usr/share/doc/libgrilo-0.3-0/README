Thanks for using Grilo!

=== What is Grilo? ===

Grilo is a framework for browsing and searching media content from various
sources using a single API.

=== Where can I find more? ===

We have a wiki page at
https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Grilo

You can subscribe to our mailing list:
http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/grilo-list

You can join us on the IRC:
#grilo on GIMPNet

=== How do I start? ===

If you are using Ubuntu you can install binary packages by configuring
our PPA, check the wiki page above for details. Otherwise you  have
to download Grilo's source code from GNOME's repository and build it
-don't worry, it takes only a few seconds-, see the section below
if you want to do that.

Once you have Grilo installed, you may want to play around with the
examples (See section "Examples") or check its documentation 
and tutorials (See section "Documentation").

=== Building from git ===

$ git clone git://git.gnome.org/grilo
$ cd grilo
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make

=== Examples ===

If you are looking for some example to play with you can try grilo-test-ui,
a simple GTK+ based test application for testing purposes. You can find it
under tools/grilo-test-ui. It allows users to:

1) Browse predefined content categories from browseable sources (like
"Youtube", "Jamendo" or "UPnP").
2) Search content by text on searchable sources (like "Youtube", "Jamanedo"
or "Flickr").
3) Query sources using source-specific syntax (for sources implementing
this feature).
4) Organize and define the source's content hierarchy (for sources
implementing this feature like "bookmarks" or
"podcasts").
5) Check available metadata for the media. 

For this application to work you need some Grilo plugins that act as media
sources, that is, plugins that provide the actual content that you will
browse and search using the application. You can get a bunch of plugins for
Grilo from the grilo-plugins package here:

http://git.gnome.org/browse/grilo-plugins

If you are looking for a step-by-step guide from beginning to end, here it is:

# Building Grilo

$ git clone git://git.gnome.org/grilo
$ cd grilo
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make

# Building Grilo Plugins and setting GRL_PLUGIN_PATH

$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PWD:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
$ cd ..
$ git clone git://git.gnome.org/grilo-plugins
$ cd grilo-plugins
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
$ make install

# Running grilo-test-ui

$ cd ../grilo
$ tools/grilo-test-ui/grilo-test-ui

=== Documentation ===

If you are looking for documentation you should add the --enable-gtk-doc
option to the autogen.sh execution:

$ ./autogen.sh --enable-gtk-doc
$ make

Then point your browser to open the file doc/reference/html/index.html

Enjoy!
