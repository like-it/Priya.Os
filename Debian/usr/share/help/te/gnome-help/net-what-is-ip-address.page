  <title>What is an IP address?</title>

  <p>"IP address" stands for <em>Internet Protocol address</em>, and each
  device that is connected to a network (like the internet) has one.</p>

  <p>An IP address is similar to your phone number. Your phone number is a
  unique set of numbers that identifies your phone so that other people can
  call you. Similarly, an IP address is a unique set of numbers that identifies
  your computer so that it can send and receive data with other computers.</p>

  <p>Currently, most IP addresses consist of four sets of numbers, each
  separated by a period. <code>192.168.1.42</code> is an example of an IP
  address.</p>

  <note style="tip">
    <p>An IP address can either be <em>dynamic</em> or <em>static</em>. Dynamic
    IP addresses are temporarily assigned each time your computer connects to a
    network. Static IP addresses are fixed, and do not change. Dynamic IP
    addresses are more common that static addresses - static addresses are
    typically only used when there is a special need for them, such as in the
    administration of a server.</p>
