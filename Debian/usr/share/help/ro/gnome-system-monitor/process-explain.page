  <title>What is a process?</title>

  <p>A <gui>process</gui> is a program or application being executed by the
 system. When an application is launched, the system assigns a unique process ID
 (PID), and its instructions and data are loaded into memory.</p>

  <p>The <gui>Processes</gui> tab displays information on processes, and allows
 you to <gui>Stop</gui>, <gui>Continue</gui>, <gui>End</gui>, <gui>Kill</gui>,
 or change the priority of a process. If you choose to display
 <gui>All Processes</gui>, the process list will include
 <em>system processes</em>, which run in the background providing various
 services that keep a computer running.</p>
