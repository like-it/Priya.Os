In your bug report, please include the following information:

- The spooler you are using (CUPS, lpd, LPRng, etc.).
- The printer make and model.
- Which driver you are using (hpijs, Gutenprint, cdj*, etc.).
- How you installed the printer PPD file (foomatic-configure, manually
  following the HOWTO's instructions, foomatic-gui, etc.).

If you are using CUPS and have just installed a new non-PostScript
printer, please try reloading the CUPS daemon before filing a report; use:
# invoke-rc.d cups reload
